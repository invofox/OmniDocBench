# Use of Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

24.10.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have encountered challenges in past projects where architectural decisions were not sufficiently documented, leading to confusion and misunderstandings among team members. This lack of proper documentation made it difficult for new team members to understand the rationale behind past decisions and slowed down the development process. To address this issue, we have decided to adopt Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) as a means of documenting and communicating our architectural decisions.

## Decision

We will use [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io) to document important architectural decisions made during the course of the project. Each ADR will provide a clear record of the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of the decision.

## Rationale

By using ADRs, we aim to achieve the following benefits:

1. **Improved Documentation:** ADRs will ensure that architectural decisions are thoroughly documented, allowing team members to understand the "why" and the thought process behind these decisions.

2. **Knowledge Transfer:** ADRs will serve as a valuable resource for onboarding new team members, facilitating knowledge transfer and reducing the time it takes for them to become productive.

3. **Decision Traceability:** ADRs will enable us to trace back the decision-making history, providing a historical record of the architectural evolution of the project.

4. **Communication and Collaboration:** ADRs will enhance communication and collaboration among team members, as they provide a structured format for discussing and documenting decisions.

## Consequences

Adopting ADRs has the following implications:

1. **Additional Documentation Effort:** ADRs require an investment of time in documenting decisions. However, this effort will pay off in the long run by improving clarity and reducing confusion.

2. **Consistency:** We need to ensure that all important architectural decisions are documented as ADRs to maintain consistency across the project.

3. **Maintenance:** ADRs should be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to reflect the current state of the project and any changes in the architectural landscape.
