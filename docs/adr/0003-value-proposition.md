# Value Proposition

24.10.2023

## Context

A concrete value proposition helps evaluate the model using common criteria. It ensures that the model's performance aligns with the established value. This focused evaluation process identifies areas for improvement in a systematic manner, driving enhancements to meet desired outcomes.

## Decision

The value proposition of the dummy model includes the following:
- *Dummy Model*: The dummy model is a simple model to test minimal Value Proposition implementation.

## Consequences

Since the dummy model is a simple model, the value proposition is limited. However, it is a good starting point to test the implementation of the value proposition. It, however, does not correspond to any real-world use case, so it does not imply any KPIs or other metrics to measure the value proposition.
